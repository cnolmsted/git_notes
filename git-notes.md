`git diff` 
will show the difference between any file that has been changed between the intermediate staging area and/or the previous comits
git log 
lists all the different commits.
git show dfqe3sdf45 shows that git commit version.
git commit -a does git add and git commit only on the things that are being tracked.
To tell git to stop worrying about things, add them to .gitignore 


Here are some more notes that I DEFINATELY DONT want to delete...
Oh crap i didn't want to write this line! How is this possible?!

Well, here i am, adding some notes to this file. I am making a branch called A, Jose'll make a branch called B, and then we'll later merge them. Not sure how that's going to work.

`git pull origin master # pull often! Perhaps you guys added some cool things.`
`git branch readme-changes # creates a branch`
`git branch # lists the existing branches`
`git checkout readme-changes # switches the current branch`
`git branch`
`git log --abbrev-commit --graph --pretty=oneline --all --decorate`

I don't understand what the last line of code is for.
